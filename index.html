                <small>Hello,</small> <h>Camille</h> is a <h>urban singer</h> with a voice that can easily melt anyone's heart. She lives in <h>Calamba, Laguna</h>.
                She's maybe one of the <h>strongest</h> people and one of the most <h>inspiring</h> and the most <h>intelligent</h> girl in the world. She's been through
                maybe some of the most toughest times and conditions but yet she never fails to impress poeple with her voice and behavior and she also inspired me and she's is a good friend of mine <small>{ Developer of this website }</small>.
                I just wish I knew her before she helped me get through the toughest time of my life and I can never thank her enough ever for that because she always renders me speechless.
