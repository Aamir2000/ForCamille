                   Camille really loves her mother and honestly we all love our parents doesn't matter mother or father. We can never imagine what our parents go through to make us stand where we are today.
                   We can never payback what they do for us. I ( Author ) always tell camille that she might not be there now but she's always with you no matter problems big or small she still worry about you
                   be happy when you're happy and sad when you're sad unfortunately I was unable to make her beleive on that I wish she ( her mother ) was here to tell her that. I'm no more than just a stranger for her
                   and no matter whatever I say she'll never understand the true value and place she's in my heart and feelings. I can never fill the gap she has in her life and nobody can its inevitable but I always try
                   to give her the right advice that'll always lead to sucess. The only way to and the best way to tribute her mother would be if Camille become successful. Last thing I would say is that She ( her mother ) is always with her
                   may god be her in peace and safe.

                    Hello Camille, If you're reading this I just want to say I made this to really honour you and you're mother. A useless website like this might not give you all the happiness
                    I want but my miserable fortune has given me no other choice to show you the true value I have for you. You know in our religion it is said that "Don't fear anything not even death of your loved ones in front of god { Allah }".
                    I wish it was that easy not to fear anything at first I didn't realised what I was getting into but now that I think about it.....its not one of the biggest fear but the only fear and the biggest fear I have is to <h>loose you</h>.
                    I can't expect you to feel the same and to be honest I don't expect anything. The last thing I would want to see is you getting hurt because of me. I just want one favour if its the last favour I'll ask you for and that's <h>"Please always share
                    everything any problems no matter big or small I would never do bad for you just want to see you happy always"</h> because I'm tired of crying thinking about you inside blanket at night it feels like I would loose everything if I lost you
                    I don't remember when was the last time I cared so much about someone but I don't know my heart always says you can't do bad with her ever <h>because that's only what you got</h> and one's its gone <h>it will never come back again</h>.
                </p>
